## What is Graduate Lecture Series in Analysis and PDEs?

Graduate Lecture Series in Analysis and PDEs (GLESPA) is a weekly seminar held at Brown University every Tuesday from 4 PM to 5:30 PM at Kassar 105. 

Each speaker (mostly graduate or postdoc students at Brown) can use 1 to 3 weeks to present a topic of their interest in Analysis or PDEs, which may or not be related to their research. If you are interested in giving a talk or if you have any questions, please contact one of the organizers.
