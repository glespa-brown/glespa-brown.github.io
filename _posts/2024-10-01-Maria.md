[Maria Prat Colomer](https://mariaprat.github.io) will give a talk at 10/01/2024.

This talk explores techniques for computer-assisted proofs in ODEs and PDEs. We will discuss the methodology behind these proofs, focusing on applications of the Banach fixed point theorem and the Newton-Kantorovich theorem to prove the existence of solutions. These examples will illustrate how computers can verify numerical computations and validate a set of analytical conditions that lead to a rigorous proof.
