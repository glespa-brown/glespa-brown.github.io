Patrick Flynn will give a talk at 3/21/2023. 

In these talks, I will discuss Hormander's 1968 paper on hypoelliptic second order differential operators. In the first lecture, I will discuss the phenomenon of hypoellipticity, some concrete examples (e.g. kinetic equations) and conclude with the statement of his theorem. In the second lecture, I'll present a (probably abridged) version of his proof.
