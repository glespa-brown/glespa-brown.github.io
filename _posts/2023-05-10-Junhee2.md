Junhee Ryu will give a talk at 10/3/2023. 

<div>
In this talk, we will discuss nonlocal equations on domains. First, we will describe nonlocal operators from various perspectives. Next, we will study the boundary behaviors of solutions to nonlocal equations. Lastly, we will prove weighted $L_p$ estimates for solutions. This talk is based on a joint work with Hongjie Dong.
