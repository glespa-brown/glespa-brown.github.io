Junhwa Jung will give a talk at 10/11/2023. 

In this talk, we will focus on the connection between the kinetic equation and the fluid equation. We call this connection a hydrodynamic limit. In the first class, I will discuss some interesting properties of the Boltzmann equation and how it is connected with fluid equations. In the second class, I will introduce my recent work and how we can prove it.
