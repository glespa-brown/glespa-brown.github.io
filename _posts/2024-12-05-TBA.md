Tainara Borges will give a talk on 02/11/2025.

Given a compact set $E$ in the plane and a point $x$ in $E$
define the pinned distance set at $x$ as
$$\Delta^{x}(E)=\{|x-y|\colon y\in E\}.$$

In this talk, we will discuss how *local smoothing estimates* for spherical
averages can be used to get the following result: If $E$ is a compact
subset of the plane with Hausdorff dimension at least $7/4$, then there
exists $x$ in $E$ such that the pinned distance set at $x$ contains an
interval. If time allows, we will mention how similar results are true for
distance sets associated with general trees with vertices in E. This talk
is based on ongoing joint work with B. Foster, Y. Ou, and E. Palsson.
