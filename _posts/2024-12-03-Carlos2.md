[Hyunwoo Kwon](https://willkwon-math.kr) will give a talk at 12/03/2024.

I will present the joint work with Hongjie Dong on nonstationary Stokes equations with variable coefficients. In the first lecture, I will present local Sobolev regularity estimates for Stokes equations when the variable viscosity coefficients have vanishing mean oscillations in spatial variables. Boundary local estimates will also be discussed when the equations are in nondivergence form. Weighted solvability for Stokes equations plays a crucial role to obtain such results. 

In the second lecture, I will discuss the spatial differentiability of weak solutions to nonstationary Stokes equations in divergence form when the viscosity coefficients have $L_2$-Dini mean oscillations. As a corollary, I will present local Schauder estimates for such equations if the viscosity coefficient is $C^\alpha_x$. Similar results also hold for strong solutions to nonstationary Stokes equations in nondivergence form.

Our result is sharp based on the well-known Serrin's example.
