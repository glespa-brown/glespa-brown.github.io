Haram Ko will give a talk on 02/04/2025.

After a quick summary of the framework explained last week, I will introduce the main theorem and the main norms to be bootstrapped. I will continue by talking about the remaining important lemmas for proving the bootstrap, and sketch the proof of the most important one, dispersive decay estimate. If time permits, I will demonstrate how these tools are used together in one specific case.
