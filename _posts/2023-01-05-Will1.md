Hyunwoo Kwon will give a talk at 03/12/2024.

In this series of survey talks, I will first show the local well-posedness of Burgers equations in Sobolev spaces. Of particular interest is to show the continuous dependence of initial data by using harmonic analytic tools, so called frequency envelope. If it is possible, I will also discuss gradient blow up for discuss Burgers equations with fractional dissipations.
