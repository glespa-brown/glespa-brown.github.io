Hyunwoo Kwon will give a talk at 03/12/2024.

I will show the local well-posedness of Burgers equations in Sobolev spaces. Of particular interest is to show the continuous dependence of initial data by using harmonic analytic tools, so called frequency envelope introduced by Tao (2000). The methodology is robust that could be applied to other quasilinear PDE models.
