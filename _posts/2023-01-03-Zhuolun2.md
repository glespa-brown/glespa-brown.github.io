Zhuolun Yang will give a talk at 12 PM, 02/22/2024 in Kassar 205.

In this series of talks, I will give a survey on a problem on the stationary Navier-Stokes equation formulated by Jean Leray around 90 years ago. The problem concerns the existence of stationary incompressible flows in the presence of interior sources and sinks, and it is still a major open problem.
