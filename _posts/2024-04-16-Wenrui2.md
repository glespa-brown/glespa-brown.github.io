Wenrui Huang will give a talk at 04/23/2024.

Dispersive estimates are crucial to studying nonlinear dispersive PDEs. One standard method for obtaining dispersive estimates is the stationary phase method. In these lectures, I will discuss the stationary phase lemma from 1D (Van Der Corput Lemma) to higher dimensions. Then, I will apply the lemma to prove dispersive estimates for many PDEs, such as the Schrodinger, KdV, wave, and Klein-Gordon Equations.
