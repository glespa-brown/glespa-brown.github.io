Cole Graham will give a talk at 11/16/2023 (Location and time is not standard, 4 PM at Kassar 205)

<div>
Last week, we discussed the effects of weak viscosity on shock formation in the Burgers equation. In this talk, we generalize the approach to (vector-valued) 1D hyperbolic conservation laws. This class includes fluid equations such as the compressible Navierâ€“Stokes and Euler equations. The vector-valued setting introduces some interesting complications. This is joint work with John Anderson and Sanchit Chaturvedi.
