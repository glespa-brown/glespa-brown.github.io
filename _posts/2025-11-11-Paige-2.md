Paige Bright (MIT) will give a talk on 11/11/2025.

Picking up where we left off last week, we dive into the proof techniques of B.-Ortiz-Zakharov towards proving a Beck-type theorem for hyperplanes in projection theory. We will present the necessary background and intuition on fractal geometry as needed, including a short discussion of Frostman's lemma and Orponen--Shmerkin--Wang and Ren's work on thin tubes.
