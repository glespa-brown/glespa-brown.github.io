Alexander Edward Ortiz(MIT) will give a talk at 01/30/2024.

Weighted estimates for operators give us insight into the shape of level sets. I will present a proof of a weighted Fourier restriction theorem for the cone based on a connection the problem has with Fourier averages and circular maximal function estimates. The first talk will go over some background, and the second talk will cover the proof and the examples I know illustrating sharpness.
