[https://abackus.github.io](Aidan Backus) will give a talk at 1/31/2023. 

Today we shall discuss the proof of Dyatlov and Jin of the fractal uncertainty principle for fractals in $\mathbb{R}$ of dimension $< 1/2$, and of a generalization to certain fractals in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that I proved jointly with Leng and Tao. Unlike other cases of the fractal uncertainty principle, which tend to require more advanced techniques from complex analysis and additive combinatorics, the main idea of the proof of Dyatlov--Jin is to get an improvement by obtaining an explicit cancellation in the phase, so the proof should be very accessible.
