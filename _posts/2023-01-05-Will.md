Hyunwoo Kwon will give a talk at 03/19/2024.

I will continue proving the local well-posedness of Burgers equations. In particular, I will show the continuous dependence by using frequency envelope. If I have enough time, I will discuss the gradient blow-up for Burgers equations with fractional dissipations. For the gradient blow-up, the talk will be based on Dong-Du-Li (2009) and Oh-Pasqualotto (2024).
