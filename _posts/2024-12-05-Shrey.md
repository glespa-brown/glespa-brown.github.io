Shrey Aryan (MIT) will give a talk on 04/29/2025.

The Soliton Resolution Conjecture predicts that solutions to nonlinear dispersive PDEs with finite energy asymptotically decouple as a sum of stationary solutions, called solitons, and free radiation with an error term going to zero in the energy norm.  In this talk, we will discuss the proof of the Soliton Resolution Conjecture for the radial energy-critical non-linear heat equation in dimension $d\geq 3$.
