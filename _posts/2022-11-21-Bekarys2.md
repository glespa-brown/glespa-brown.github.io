Bekarys Bekmaganbetov will give a talk at 3/7/2023. 

This time I will give a proof of the weighted Fefferman-Stein theorem in the setting of homogeneous type spaces, following the proof of H. Dong and D. Kim (2018). Then we will discuss how it is used in obtaining a priori estimates and solvability for linear parabolic PDEs in weighted mixed-norm Sobolev spaces.
