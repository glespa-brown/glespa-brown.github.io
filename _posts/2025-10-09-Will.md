Hyunwoo Kwon will give a talk on 10/09/2025.

Bernstein inequality is a simple analytical tool but it is crucial to measure the smoothness of the functions to seek a solution of PDEs in an appropriate function space. However, there are some cases that we cannot use Bernstein inequalities that were recently observed by Li-Sire (2023) https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07952 . I will briefly discuss what Bernstein inequalities are and what a counterexample of this type indicates.
