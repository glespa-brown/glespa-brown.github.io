Paraproducts and commutator estimates play important roles not only in harmonic analysis but also PDEs. It has wide applications including fluid mechanics and kinetic theory. In this talk, I will give a motivation from MHD equations and study the paraproduct method to prove the Coifman-Meyer theorem and Kato-Ponce commutator estimates. 
As a result, we prove the following commutator estimates:

$$J^s f$$
