Beckett Sanchez will give a talk on 09/23/2025.

The celebrated Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) is a nonlinear dispersive equation modeling surface waves in a shallow canal. In this talk, we will investigate a generalization of the KdV
equation with low-powered nonlinearity and 5th-order dispersive term (5gKdV), motivated by several physical phenomena. We construct local solutions to this model with initial data in a weighted Sobolev space, and then discuss global perspectives. The results in this talk are a
part of ongoing joint work with Chandler Haight from Florida International University.
