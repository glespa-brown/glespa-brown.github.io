Paige Bright (MIT) will give a talk on 11/04/2025.

Radial projections have been a quickly developing topic in harmonic analysis. The work of Orponen--Shmerkin--Wang connected this topic to a continuum Beck theorem for lines, finding a (lower) bound for the dimension of lines that contain at least two points in a given subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Since then, results of Ren and B.-Marshall, have studied similar Beck-type theorems for lines in higher dimensions. Recent work of B.--Ortiz--Zakharov has utilized these radial projection results to study a Beck-type theorem for hyperplanes which will be the focus of the first lecture.
