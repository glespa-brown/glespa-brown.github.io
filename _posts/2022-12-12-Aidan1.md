Aidan Backus will give a talk at 1/31/2023. 

An open manifold $M$ is said to have an essential spectral gap if the Schr√∂dinger equation on $M$ has only 
finitely many resonant states with resonance close to the real line. If $M$ is hyperbolic, then one can prove 
the existence of an essential spectral gap by showing that one cannot localize a function and its Fourier 
transform to a neighborhood of the boundary at infinity of $\pi_1(M)$.

We shall see that the above considerations are one manifestation of a general principle called the fractal 
uncertainty principle, which says that one cannot localize a function and a Fourier transform to the 
neighborhood of a fractal. Time permitting we will also sketch some of the ideas used in the proofs of the 
various cases of the fractal uncertainty principle.
