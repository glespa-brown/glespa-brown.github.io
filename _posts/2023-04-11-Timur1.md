Timur Yastrzhembskiy will give a talk at 4/18/2023. 

We will discuss the global well-posedness (GWP) of the nonlinear kinetic Landau equation near Maxwellian on $T^3$. We will focus on the nonlinear energy method developed by Yan Guo. If time permits, we will also discuss the GWP for the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system near relativistic Maxwellian, established by Yan Guo and Robert Strain. No knowledge of nonlinear equations is required.
