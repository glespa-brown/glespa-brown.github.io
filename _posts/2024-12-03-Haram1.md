Haram Ko will give a talk on 01/28/2025.

I will begin by introducing the general scheme of proving small data global existence of quasilinear dispersive equations. The framework needed for specific example(s), 3d incompressible Euler-(Navier-Stokes-)Coriolis equations, will be explained which includes dispersion and dispersive variables, the vector fields, and the localizations. If time permits, I will briefly discuss different integration by parts methods that will be used in the proof, and the relevant analysis of phase.
